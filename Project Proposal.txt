We plan to pursue the clustering project (clustering NBA players) using a new clustering algorithm developed by Katherine More ‘12 who recently presented at
a Math Monday. We also plan to use Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, we will develop a method for determining lineup 
similarity

This measure of lineup similarity has a variety of applications: (1) Since we know the distance between lineups, we can further cluster lineups using Moore’s 
algorithm. (2) Using player clusters as the players in a lineup information about typical lineups such as a team’s performance against a type of lineup and 
what counter-lineups are more effective. (3) For scouting purposes, our method of calculating lineup distance can be used to see which potential trades 
result in a lineup most similar to the original lineup. Trading to keep a similar type of lineup may take the burden off of a coach who might otherwise have 
to significantly alter their game-plan to suit their new lineup.

After reviewing several articles on clustering attempts, we plan to use the following variables obtained from basketball-reference. We plan to use data from 
the 2018-2019 season as this was the last complete season.
